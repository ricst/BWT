The BWT (BandWidth Test) App provides a simple approach to real world 
bandwidth measurement.  Users may select up to three different URLs and
then see the download bandwidth for each of them.

BWT provides one view with a "mini browser" that allows navigation
to a desired page, which may then be tested.  An alternate view allows
users to select 1, 2 or 3 URLs for simultaneous bandwidth testing.

BWT is designed for anyone who wants to determine their current bandwidth
to sites that they connect to.  Sites may be changed as often
as desired.  

It's ideal for system, network and 
web site administrators who need to monitor bandwidth to their systems.
